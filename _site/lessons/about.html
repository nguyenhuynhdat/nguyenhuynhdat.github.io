      <p>Show you how to use Ubuntu with Openbox as a Window Manager. 
</p>
        <p>Hi you all,</p>

<p>My name is Dat and I am from Vietnam. I learned Linux as a hobby back then but eventually nowadays I am using Linux on everything I can (my desktop with Ubuntu LTS, my laptop with Debian Jessie or my Raspberry Pi with Runeaudio).</p>

<p>This site is created out of the love for Debian/ Ubuntu and Openbox. Although the though of not having enough knowledge to write this website is always lurking at the back of my mind, writing it has been a journey of pure joy.</p>

<p>The saying “The best way of to something is to teach it” is absolutely right. I have learned a lot since then.</p>

<p>I have also received a lot of encourage emails from people reading this website, their complements as well as their offers for help… they are all of the best source of motivation to me. Please do not hesitate to share your thoughts with me on the Facebook of the site: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox">facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox</a></p>

<p>Hope you will enjoy the website and found it helpful!</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Dat H. Nguyen</p>

<p>Why Ubuntu?</p>

<p>I am choosing Ubuntu because it is the most recognizable name in Linux world. The target readers of this website are those have been using pre-configured Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, openSUSE…) and have had a general idea of what Linux is all about. But newbies is okay too!</p>

<p>And it is also for those whose seek the way to install of a Operating System which contains only what they want (i.e the minimal way!)</p>

<p>Why Openbox?</p>

<p>First and foremost: Openbox is Awesome!</p>

<p>And next:</p>

<p>To busting a bit of the myth of “how the components of your Ubuntu system working together”.</p>

<p>Because a Window Manager only gives you a “box” on the screen in which your program will run, you will have the space for your creativity to add all the other parts of the OS on your own.</p>

<p>Through that experience, you should learn a lot.</p>
