      <p>Show you how to use Ubuntu with Openbox as a Window Manager. 
</p>
        <h1 id="greeting-from-vietnam">Greeting from Vietnam</h1>

<p>Hi you all,</p>

<p>My name is Dat and I am from Vietnam. I learned Linux as a hobby years ago but eventually nowadays, I am using Linux on everything I can (my desktop with Ubuntu LTS, my laptop with Debian Jessie or my Raspberry Pi with Runeaudio).</p>

<p>This site is created out of the love for Debian/ Ubuntu and Openbox. Although the though of “who am I to write this kind of tutorial?” is always lurking at the back of my mind, writing it has been a journey of pure joy.</p>

<p>The saying “The best way to learn something is to teach it” is absolutely right. I have learned a lot since then.</p>

<p>I have also received a lot of encouraging emails from people around the world who read this website - their compliments as well as their offers for help. They are all of the best source of motivation to me. Please do not hesitate to share your thoughts with me on the Facebook of the site: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox">facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox</a></p>

<p>Hope you will enjoy your read and found my information helpful!</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Dat Huynh Nguyen</p>

<h1 id="why-ubuntu">Why Ubuntu?</h1>

<p>I am choosing Ubuntu because it is the most recognizable name in Linux world, but all Linux should find this tutorial helpful. In fact, the testings for each the tutorial sections were done on my Laptop running Debian Jessie (I personally recommend Debian because I find no other distro can be as reliable as a Debian).</p>

<h1 id="why-openbox">Why Openbox?</h1>

<p>First and foremost: Openbox is Awesome!</p>

<p>And next:</p>

<p>To busting a bit of the myth of “how do the components of your Ubuntu system work together?”.</p>

<p>Because a Window Manager only gives you the “boxes” on the screen in which your programs will run, you will have the space for your creativity to add all the other parts of the OS on your own.</p>

<p>Linux OS is modular and to choose and to assemble those modules is a great experience.</p>

<p>Through it, you should learn a lot.</p>

<h1 id="who-are-the-target-readers">Who are the target readers?</h1>

<p>The website is for those who are seeking the way to install a Operating System containing only what packages they want (i.e the customizing way!), and those who are seeking information for a minimal installation.</p>

<p>At first, I thought the target readers of this website had better be who had been using pre-configured Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, openSUSE…) and had a general idea of what Linux was. Along the way, I have tried to give as much as information for it is easy for everyone else.</p>
