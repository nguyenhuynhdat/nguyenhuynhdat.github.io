<h2 id="icon-theme-for-ubuntu-openbox">Icon theme for Ubuntu Openbox</h2>

<p>Take a look at two Thunar windows in the screenshot. I have applied “AwOken” icon set (its name is really written like that, not a typo)</p>

<p>To install a icon theme, either install via PPAs or copy (the extracted) icon folder directly to /usr/share/icons or ~/.icons</p>

<p>Adding a PPA is often frowned upon, but since the PPA for AwOken theme is really popular. The risk is low!</p>

<p>You need to install <strong>software-properties-common</strong> to be able to add PPA using command line, to install it:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here is how I have installed AwOken icon theme, as guided here:</p>

<p>http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/AwOken?content=126344</p>

<p>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alecive/antigone</p>

<p>sudo apt-get update</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install awoken-icon-theme</p>

<p>AwOken is a special theme that have it own script to customize itself, here is the instruction given by the author, skim through it and you will see how awesome it is: <a href="/assets/Installation_and_Instructions.pdf">Installation and Instructions (PDF)</a></p>

<p>Or if you want to learn by doing, below is the command to trigger all the options. The instruction a long the way is easy to understand and follow:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>awoken-icon-theme-customization
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Apply the icon theme.</p>

<p>Open Lxappearance to change the icon-theme to AwOken.</p>

<p>Here is how the icon theme is on my system:</p>
